# Cautions

- **Always Movable**: Pressing ZR or R button outside of the game (during the announcement of the Results, in the Plaza, Lobby, etc.) *FREEZE THE GAME!* (EXC. A/B, +/- button!)

- **Charger Auto Aim**: Occasionally misses.

- **All Hit / All Painting**: When applying, be SURE to APPLY **TurfWar Points**!! (*Because you will be **BANNED** if **exceed 100,000 TurfWar Points!!!***)

- **Tower Control/Immediate Tower Knockout/Infinite Explosion Rainmaker Barrier**: Only work when you are the host (When you are at the top of the matching).

- **Skip PlazaNews**: If you apply Anti Drowning at the same time, you'll get STUCK!!

- **Team Change**: It's better to wait until the end of the game to change team as it often FREEZE!

- **Anti Drowning**: Suicide is NOT working while this cheat applying. *Also, if you stay in the water for too long, you will almost get an ERROR!*
