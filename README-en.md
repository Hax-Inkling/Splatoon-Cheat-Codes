# Cautions

- **Always Movable**: Pressing ZR or R outside of the game (during the announcement of the results, in the square, in the lobby, etc.) freezes the game.

- **Charger Auto Aim**: Occasionally misses instead of hitting.

- **All hit / All painting**: When applying, be sure to apply paint point fixation! (*Because you will be banned if you exceed 100,000 points*)

- **Tower Control/Tower Immediate Knockout/Rainmaker Barrier Infinite Explosion**: Reflected only when you are the host (when you are at the top of the match).

- **News Skip**: If you apply drowning immunity at the same time, you'll get stuck.

- **Team Change**: It's better to wait until the end of the game to change team as it often freezes.
