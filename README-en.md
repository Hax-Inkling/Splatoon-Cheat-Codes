- **Charger Auto Aim**: Occasionally misses instead of hitting.

- **All hit / All painting**: When applying, be sure to apply TurfWar Points!! (*Because you will be BANNED if exceed 100,000 TurfWar Points!!!*)

- **Tower Control/Tower Immediate Knockout/Rainmaker Barrier Infinite Explosion**: Reflected only when you are the host (When you are at the top of the matching).

- **News Skip**: If you apply Anti Drowning at the same time, you'll get STUCK!!

- **Team Change**: It's better to wait until the end of the game to change team as it often freeze.
